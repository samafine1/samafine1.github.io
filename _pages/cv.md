**RESEARCH INTERESTS**

Theory, design and control of physical systems that can represent and manipulate quantum information. I am particularly drawn toward two intersections of quantum computing theory and application:

* *Overcoming Noise:* Methods to more efficiently encode and process quantum information that minimize  
  control complexity and error susceptibility in resource-limited, near-term devices.  
* *Characterization:* Developing the theory and computational tools to calibrate and control quantum systems.

**RESEARCH EXPERIENCE**

**Quantum Error Correction for Correlated Noise						     June 2025-Present**  
Advised by [Liang Jiang](https://pme.uchicago.edu/faculty/liang-jiang)											       *Chicago, IL*

* Designing and verifying teleportation-based fault-tolerant protocols for correlated noise.  
* Explored the sample complexity of machine-learning based surface code decoders for higher-order errors.

**Robust Quantum Optimal Control								     May 2025-Present**  
Advised by [Fred Chong](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ftchong/) 										       *Chicago, IL*

* Identified a critical discretization correction for a widely-used robustness estimator.  
* Running experiments on quantum hardware to show measurable improvement using the corrected metric.  
* Exploring the theoretical and practical trade-offs between control complexity and error susceptibility.

Advised by [Philipp Windischhofer](https://physics.uchicago.edu/people/profile/phillipp-windischofer/)              	 	  						       *Chicago, IL*

* Investigated how modern machine learning methods can help to extract the maximum amount of  information about the self-interactions of the Higgs boson from the data sets recorded at the LHC.  
* Applied neural networks to define highly-compressed, information-preserving statistics of the original data.
