My research interests are broadly in the theory, design and control of physical systems that can represent and manipulate coherent quantum information.

When I am not researching, I am often found reading, in nature, or eating vegetables, occasionally all at once.

But lately, I have mostly been preparing for PhD applications.

I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library. - Borges
