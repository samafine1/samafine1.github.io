I am a student at UChicago studying CS, math and physics.

My research interests are broadly in quantum computing theory, with a focus on connections to real-world experiments.

When I am not doing research, I am often found reading, in nature, or with friends, occasionally all at once.

Lately I've been mostly applying to PhD programs.
